      "3. **Control Unit**: Coordinates the flow of data between different parts of the CPU. It manages the transfer of data between the CPU and other components, such as memory and input/output (I/O) devices.\n",
      "4. ** Registers**: Small, memory-based storage units that hold data temporarily while it is being processed. Registers are used for fast, direct access to data.\n",
      "5. **Instruction Bus**: A communication channel between the CPU and other components, such as memory and I/O devices. It allows the CPU to read and write instructions to the memory.\n",
      "6. **Memory**: Provides storage for data and program instructions. There are several types of memory, including RAM (Random Access Memory) and ROM (Read-Only Memory).\n",
      "7. **Input/Output (I/O) Interface**: Allows the CPU to interact with other components, such as keyboards, displays, and devices like printers and scanners.\n",
      "8. **Power Supply**: Provides power to the CPU and other components. The power supply generates an alternating current (AC) voltage, which is converted to a direct current (DC) voltage using a rectifier.\n",
      "\n",
      "These components work together to enable a microprocessor to perform calculations, execute instructions, and interact with other components to achieve its goals.\n"
